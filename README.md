Developer Documentation: When it comes to the architecture and design of our website, we have strived to strike a perfect balance. While embracing a simplistic approach, we also ensured that it exudes a modern and organized feel, enhancing its usability and navigation. Drawing inspiration from websites with minimalist designs, we aimed to harmonize our website's aesthetics with subdued and carefully chosen background colors, veering away from overly bright tones. One aspect we take pride in is the implementation of Parallax Scrolling, accomplished solely using pure CSS language. This feature was inspired by a Performance Task in Media, specifically the one crafted within Google Sites. Incorporating this dynamic scrolling effect has added a touch of elegance and interactivity to our website, elevating the overall user experience. Selecting the appropriate theme for the Home Page posed a challenge, given that it revolves around former basketball players and their jerseys. Locating suitable photos from the 1990s, capturing the essence of these iconic athletes, proved to be somewhat demanding. However, through meticulous effort and research, we managed to curate a collection that resonates with the theme, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the rich history of these legendary players.

Above all, we take great satisfaction in the functionality of our website. The seamless navigation, combined with its visually appealing design, contributes to a user-friendly and engaging browsing experience. We are proud to offer a platform that not only presents captivating content but also ensures ease of use for every visitor who explores our digital space.
